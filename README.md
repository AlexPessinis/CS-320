# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can help ensure functionality and security by writing thorough unit tests, validating all inputs, and 
following defensive programming practices. Regular code reviews and adherence to secure coding standards help 
prevent vulnerabilities and ensure the software behaves as expected. Testing both valid and invalid scenarios 
strengthens reliability and reduces the risk of unexpected failures.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by breaking down requirements into clear, testable behaviors and translating them into 
specific features or constraints. Each requirement becomes a validation rule, method behavior, or service operation 
that directly reflects what the user expects. This approach ensures the final program aligns closely with the user’s 
goals and functional expectations.

# How do I approach designing software?
I will approach software design by first understanding the problem domain, then creating simple, modular components 
that each handle a single responsibility. I prioritize clarity, maintainability, and scalability, ensuring that each 
class or service is easy to test and extend. This structured approach leads to clean architecture and reduces technical 
debt over time.
